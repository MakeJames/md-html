### Block 3: Lists and quotes

1. Initialize the **frob layer**:
    - Compute delta flux.
    - Adjust *pseudo-nodal bias* if necessary.
        - Note: do **not** conflate with semi-factual torsion fields.
2. Iterate through *orbital segments*:
    1. Deconstruct local loops.
    1. Re-synchronize dampened echoes.
3. Finalize with an ephemeral mutex.
